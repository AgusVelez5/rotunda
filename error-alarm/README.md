# Error Alarm Exercise

Suppose we have a web application that runs on a single server. Errors that
occur from time to time during normal operation of the application are logged to a
text file that is stored in the file system on the server.

We are not concerned about these errors when their frequency is low. However,
when lots of errors occur in a short period of time, there may be a problem with
the application and we want to be notified immediately. Specifically,â€‹ _when more
than ten errors occur in one minute, we want to receive an email notification_.

In general terms or pseudo code, how would you implement such an alarm?

Please assume:

1. The general paradigm of logging errors to a text file will be kept in place.
2. There exists a function

    ```
    function logError( error )
    ```

    This function is called each time there is an error and appends the error to
    the end of the log file.

3. We never want to receive more than one email notification per minute.

### Solution

I think we can track the last 10 errors, if they are in a 1 minute period we will send the email. 

For this objective we can wrap the `logError` function with a class that has the necessary 
attributes and logic to do the mentioned tracking. 

It is necessary to clarify that this class would be a singleton in order to include the errors of 
the whole application (it would be possible to use an instance by module to have more specific mails).
